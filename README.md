# Software Development Final Assignment


### Version 1.0.1


## How to Use the package.json Scripts
--------------------------------------
In this version of the Final Assignment, I have included three scripts that you can run: `compile`, `start`, and `build`.

* `compile`, runs the tsc command and compiles the project

Ecample:

    ```
    npm run compile
    ```

* `start`, runs the index.js file in the "dist" folder, which is created by the tsconfig.json file.

Example:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```
* `build`, runs both the `compile`, and `start` scripts
 
 Example:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```
