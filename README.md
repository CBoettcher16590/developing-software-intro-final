# Software Development Final Assignment


### Version 1.0.5


## How to Use the package.json Scripts
--------------------------------------
In this version of the Final Assignment, I have included eight scripts that you can run: `compile`, `start`, `format`, `lint`, `test`, `test:coverage`, `build`, and `build:dev`

### Compile

* `compile`, runs the tsc command and compiles the project

Ecample:

```
npm run compile
```

### Start

* `start`, runs the index.js file in the "dist" folder, which is created by the tsconfig.json file.

Example:

```
npm run start
```

### ESLint

* `lint`, runs eslint to "lint" our code. ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

Example:

```
npm run lint
```

### Prettier

* `format`, runs the npm package "prettier". This auto format our code to make it look pretty.

Example:

```
npm run format
```

### Test

* `test`, runs the tests that we write in our "tests" folder.

Example:

```
npm run test
```


### Test with Coverage

* `test:coverage`, runs the tests for the project, as well as displaying a coverage map using "nyc/istanbul" that shows how much of our code was tested. 

Example:

```
npm run test:coverage
```


### Build

* `build`, runs both the `compile`, and `start` scripts
 
 Example:

```
npm run build
```

### Build:dev

* `build:dev`, runs all the commands. First `lint`, followed by `prettier`, `test` and then it will compile and run the program.
 
 Example:

```
npm run build:dev
```
